Now is the time to close the file
Second line
A wave of love for you just knocked me off my chair
I will love you and love you
I will reach out my hand to you in the noise of carhorns and merengue and pull you close by the waist
I will call you my museum of everything always
I will call you MDMA
I love you ecstatic exalted sublime
I wish you were here—there’s an enormous cloud sitting off in the distance
It’s a beautiful walk from there to my place
I’m buzzing but the buzzer may not be working
There’s a raccoon rearing on hind legs twitching its nose from behind a short fence
Let me stew you some tomatoes
As long as I keep moving the overtones don’t jackhammer my skull
I am waiting for something very very good
My phone is like, what, I’m a phone
